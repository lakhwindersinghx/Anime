		<!-- About -->
		<h2>What's this anime about?</h2>
		<p>Ushio Hinomaru is a stout, far below average height 16-year-old. He has long reddish black hair, which in some panels appears to resemble fire. In coloured illustrations, he is shown to have amber eyes. He also has a scar on his lower left cheek. Hinomaru's shown to have multiple scars on his muscular body from his harsh training. Despite this, there is a strong physical resemblance to his mother aside from a quite prominent Adam's apple, but as he grows older, his face becomes more masculine. In the anime, however, this resemblance is lost.

In his debut, during tournaments and in illustrations, he's shown only to wear a jacket over his chest and his mawashi, and sometimes he wears the jacket like a cape. He's also known for wearing a gakuran, rather than the Dachi HIgh western-style uniform.

After the time skip, he's shown wearing a black and red yukata with a flame motif and his shikona embroidered on it, as well as having his hair styled in the traditional topknot. However, during the stay at his grandparents' home, he changed into a T-shirt and pants when going to sleep.</p>
